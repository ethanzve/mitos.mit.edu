I understand that Vinicius is frustrated because he doesn\u2019t understand about the division of powers (for dealing with racism), but I\u2019m also frustrated because I do know about it and there were no sanctions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tebas said he hadn\u2019t yet spoken to Vinicius but would be willing to do so and would say, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry if you felt offended but I wasn\u2019t trying to attack you\u2019 and I would tell him again that like him, I\u2019m also frustrated.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his tweet on Sunday night, Tebas wrote, \u201cbefore criticising and insulting La Liga, you need to be properly informed\u201d about the division of powers when it comes to imposing sanctions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Spanish law, La Liga can only identify and report cases of racism but it is not empowered to impose sanctions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, it called for more sanctioning power to act against fans for violent, racist or xenophobic behaviour, saying it felt \u201cpowerless\u201d when its incident reports failed to result in any punitive action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018A great player\u2019<br>Tebas said only the Spanish football federation had the ability to impose sanctions and reiterated calls for La Liga to be granted sanctioning power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want the power to act because with that, we\u2019re sure that within months, we\u2019ll be able to resolve this problem,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tebas said that when he took over as league chief in 2013, the stadiums were filled with \u201cracist and homophobic chanting. I remember people shouting \u2018Messi is retarded\u2019,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe insisted that this disappear from the stadiums and we did it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are very aware that Vinicius is being insulted because he\u2019s such a great player.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also expressed frustration that no other body had supported La Liga when it filed legal complaints about racism in stadiums, especially when it came to the case of Vinicius.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn all our complaints, we have filed suit alone, we\u2019ve never been backed by any other institution and in Vinicius\u2019 case, not even by Real Madrid,\u201d he said after the club accused La Liga and the federation of being passive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Liga has filed various lawsuits in relation to racist abuse suffered by Vinicius<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVinicius is different. He\u2019s not your average player. I\u2019m convinced that he\u2019ll win the Ballon d\u2019Or at some stage,\u201d Tebas said, adding he hoped the Brazilian would keep playing in the Spanish league because \u201che\u2019s a very important asset for his club and for La Liga\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the league had been carefully watching Vinicius\u2019 away games for any further signs of racial abuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tebas said he was worried that what had happened could affect the Spanish league\u2019s image, insisting that \u201cSpain is not a racist country and Spanish football isn\u2019t racist.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a blow but there\u2019s no point crying about it. We have to work to restore any reputation that may have been lost,\u201d said Tebas, who said he doesn\u2019t think the scandal will affect Spain, Portugal and Morocco\u2019s joint bid for the 2030 World Cup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t affect it, we\u2019re showing what we\u2019re going and we will get better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a long way off.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>La Liga chief Javier Tebas insisted Thursday he didn\u2019t mean \u201cto criticise\u201d Vinicius Junior following a charged exchange on Twitter after the Real Madrid forward was racially abused during a march.

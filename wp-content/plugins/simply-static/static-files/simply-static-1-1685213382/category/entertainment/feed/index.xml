<p>At 86, British director Ken Loach showed he still had fighting spirit at Cannes, presenting his latest moving homage to working class solidarity and saying: &#8220;we&#8217;re still in the game&#8221;.</p>



<p>Loach has had no fewer than 15 films in competition at the Cannes Film Festival &#8212; and won the top prize Palme d&#8217;Or twice.</p>



<p>His dedication to left-wing causes and showing the often harsh reality of working class Britain remains undimmed in his 16th entry, ‘The Old Oak’, which premiered on Friday.</p>



<p>It tells the story of a struggling pub in a depressed ex-mining town in northern England, whose landlord helps Syrian refugees despite his own problems.</p>



<p>Deadline called it a &#8220;vital, moving social parable&#8221; and The Guardian a &#8220;fierce final call for compassion&#8221;.</p>



<p>Despite widespread anti-immigrant feeling in Britain, Loach said there are still many working class communities who have shown solidarity with refugees.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have a tradition of solidarity born out of industrial struggle,&#8221; Loach told AFP at the festival. &#8220;There are whole sections of people who campaign for refugees.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said ‘The Old Oak’ was a necessary blast of positivity after more downbeat recent films, ‘I, Daniel Blake’ (which won the Palme in 2016) and ‘Sorry We Missed You’.</p>



<p>&#8220;Without hope there&#8217;s despair, and then you&#8217;re open to the far right and that destroys us,&#8221; Loach said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The working class is not defeated, we&#8217;re still in the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked about still directing in his mid-80s, Loach joked: &#8220;If you get up and read the obituary columns and you&#8217;re not in them, it&#8217;s a good day. But I&#8217;ve been lucky to keep some health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hard graft<br>His long-time writing partner Paul Laverty was full of praise for Loach&#8217;s dedication, saying the director still worked late for months on end to cast the film from local communities.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was like six months hard graft,&#8221; Laverty said, before having a friendly dig: &#8220;That&#8217;s fine when you&#8217;re 30 but when you&#8217;re 105…&#8221;</p>



<p>Laverty had far less kind things to say about Britain&#8217;s politicians, saying that Home Secretary Suella Braverman, known for her anti-migrant rhetoric, displayed &#8220;remarkable cruelty&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a scumbag who lives off the misery of other people,&#8221; said Laverty.</p>



<p>Solidarity used to mean &#8220;joining together and sharing,&#8221; Loach said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, it means charity… giving a small amount to the poor provided they are grateful and deserving and don&#8217;t cause a fuss and look like victims.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking about the deterioration of the National Health Service, Loach said &#8220;the extent of the crisis is catastrophic&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have the most sophisticated political class in the world controlling the image of Britain, but you look inside and it&#8217;s rotten to the core.&#8221;</p>
